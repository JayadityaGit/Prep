I shared my leadership experiences and mentioned the technical website I developed during college, which helped set a friendly and confident tone for the interview.</p><h3 id="🧩-coding-questions" tabindex="-1">🧩 Coding Questions <a class="header-anchor" href="#🧩-coding-questions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🧩 Coding Questions&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>1️⃣ Implement a Queue using Stacks and a Stack using Queues</strong><br> I started with the standard implementation and clearly explained the <strong>time and space complexity</strong>.<br> Then, the interviewer asked me to <strong>optimize it</strong> using an <strong>OOP-based approach</strong> to achieve constant-time operations.<br> Initially, I struggled a bit but later reasoned through different strategies and successfully designed a more efficient solution. The interviewer appreciated my problem-solving process and persistence.</p><p>📘 You can practice these questions here:</p><ul><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/"

problem</strong> — implementing the <strong>0/1 Knapsack</strong>.<br> I chose to solve it using <strong>memoization</strong>, explaining each <strong>state transition</strong> clearly.<br> Although my first attempt had a small bug, I quickly debugged and fixed it, demonstrating my structured thought process and attention to detail.</p><p>🧠 If you’d like to practice similar DP

<strong>project-based</strong>, and <strong>team-related</strong> discussions.</p><p>The interviewer began by asking about my <strong>resume projects</strong>, especially my <strong>robotics project</strong> with the <strong>NITS Yantranav team</strong>, where I worked on an <strong>autonomous drone</strong>.</p><p>She asked:</p><ul><li>“What were the main challenges you faced while working on this project?”</li><li>“How did you handle team conflicts or technical issues?”</li><li>“Can you describe a situation where you had to take initiative?”</li></ul><p>I explained how we faced issues during the <strong>sensor integration</strong> phase and how I coordinated with teammates to solve them effectively through communication and collaboration.</p><p>Then, she shifted focus to my <strong>Machine Learning project</strong>, asking:</p><ul><li>“What motivated you to choose this project?”</li><li>“What were your key takeaways from it?”</li><li>“How does it connect to real-world applications?”</li></ul><p>I discussed the project’s objective, the <strong>ML model used</strong>, and what I learned about <strong>data handling, optimization</strong>, and <strong>practical

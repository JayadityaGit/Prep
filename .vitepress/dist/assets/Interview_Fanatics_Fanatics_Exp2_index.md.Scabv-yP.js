cases to verify correctness.</p><p>📘 You can practice this problem here:</p><ul><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/" target="_blank"

to zero.<br> I approached it using <strong>sorting + two-pointer</strong> logic to reduce complexity from <code>O(n³)</code> to <code>O(n²)</code>.<br> After implementation, I discussed edge cases and handling duplicates.</p><p>💡 Reference:</p><ul><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Three Sum – LeetCode Problem</a></li></ul><hr><h3

HR Interview <a class="header-anchor" href="#🗣️-round-1-–-hr-interview" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🗣️ Round 1 – HR Interview&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The first round was a <strong>standard HR discussion</strong> focused on behavioral and psychological understanding.<br> The interviewer mainly tried to gauge <strong>how I think, react, and communicate</strong> in general situations.</p><p>Some of the questions asked included:</p><ul><li>“What skills did you learn in college that can help you in the corporate world (other than technical skills)?”</li><li>“How do you usually handle disagreements in a team?”</li><li>“What motivates you to do your best work?”</li></ul><p>The tone of the round was friendly and conversational, with an emphasis on <strong>personality, mindset, and interpersonal skills</strong> rather than technical depth.</p><p>🧠 <strong>Helpful Resources:</strong></p><ul><li><a

minutes)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This round turned out to be <strong>a mix of HR and technical discussions</strong>.<br> The interviewer was an <strong>Associate Director</strong>, and surprisingly, the first <strong>one hour</strong> felt more like a deep personality and mindset conversation.</p><p>He asked questions such as:</p><ul><li>“What philosophy do you believe in your life?”</li><li>“How do you handle failure or criticism?”</li><li>“What defines success for you?”</li></ul><p>The discussion was thought-provoking and tested my <strong>emotional intelligence</strong>, <strong>consistency</strong>, and <strong>self-awareness</strong> rather than just technical skill.</p><p>In the last part of the interview, I was asked:</p><ul><li>One <strong>DSA problem</strong>, which was based on arrays (medium-level).<br> 📘 Practice similar problems here: <ul><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Two Sum –

advanced topic.<br> We discussed the project architecture, activation functions, and what challenges I faced during implementation.</p><p>If you’re working on similar topics, you can refer

interviews, this one tested <strong>depth of thinking, composure, and reasoning</strong> as much as technical skill.<br> The interviewer’s unique style pushed me to think critically about my beliefs and approach, making it one of the most memorable interviews I’ve had.</p><hr><h2 id="💡-advice-for-others" tabindex="-1">💡 Advice for Others <a class="header-anchor" href="#💡-advice-for-others" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;💡 Advice for Others&quot;">​</a></h2><p>✨ <strong>Be yourself — not rehearsed.</strong><br> Many interviews at this level are designed to test <strong>your authenticity</strong>, not your ability to give perfect answers.</p><p>🧩 <strong>Prepare your resume like a story.</strong><br> Be ready to talk about every project or achievement with passion and clarity, especially if it’s something complex like ML or AI.</p><p>💬 <strong>Don’t fear unexpected questions.</strong><br> Sometimes, interviewers test how you <strong>think under uncertainty</strong> rather than what you already know. Take a pause, breathe, and answer calmly.</p><p>📘 <strong>Recommended Prep:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hr-interview-questions-and-answers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HR Interview Questions – GeeksforGeeks</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Top DSA Patterns to Practice – LeetCode Explore</a></li><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-explain-projects-in-an-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Explain Projects in Interviews – GeeksforGeeks</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="🏁-result" tabindex="-1">🏁 Result <a class="header-anchor" href="#🏁-result" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🏁 Result&quot;">​</a></h2><p>✅ <strong>Selected for Optum TDP Intern (On-Campus)</strong></p><hr><p><strong>✍️ Shared by:</strong> Anonymous</p><hr><h3 id="🔗-related-links" tabindex="-1">🔗 Related Links <a class="header-anchor" href="#🔗-related-links" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🔗 Related Links&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hr-interview-questions-and-answers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HR Interview Questions – GeeksforGeeks</a></li><li><a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/behavioral-interview-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Behavioral Interview Questions – Indeed</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Two Sum – LeetCode</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock – LeetCode</a></li><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/neural-network-introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Neural Network Introduction – GeeksforGeeks</a></li><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-neural-network-from-scratch-32f55b7a19ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Building a Neural Network from Scratch – Towards Data Science</a></li><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-explain-projects-in-an-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Explain Projects in Interviews – GeeksforGeeks</a></li><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/optum-interview-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Optum Interview Experiences – GeeksforGeeks</a></li></ul>',41)])])}const g=r(a,[["render",i]]);export{p as __pageData,g as default};

Interview (Duration: 8–10 minutes)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The first round was a short and friendly <strong>HR interview</strong>.<br> The questions were focused on <strong>situational and behavioral</strong> topics that tested communication, clarity, and emotional intelligence.</p><p>Some of the questions asked were:</p><ul><li>“Tell me a time when you had to explain a very complex topic to your friends or someone, and how did they respond?”</li><li>“Tell me a time when you challenged yourself to do something, and what was its result?”</li></ul><p>The key in this round was <strong>storytelling</strong> — how you present yourself and the flow of your answers matters more than what you actually did.<br> The interviewer seemed interested in understanding <strong>your thought process and personality</strong>.</p><p>💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Be expressive and detailed when sharing your story, small details make your answers feel real and help you connect with the interviewer.</p><p>📘 <strong>Preparation Help:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/behavioral-interview-questions" target="_blank"

contributions.</li><li>A few <strong>questions about Python libraries</strong> I had used.</li><li>Some <strong>basic frontend concepts</strong> and how I applied them in my work.</li></ul><p>The
